# Mobile App Boilerplate with Clean Architecture

## Introduction

Welcome to the Mobile App Boilerplate project! This boilerplate is designed to help you kickstart your React Native mobile app development with a clean architecture. The goal is to provide a scalable, maintainable, and testable structure for your mobile applications.

## Why Use This Boilerplate?

1. **Clean Architecture**: Promotes separation of concerns, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.
2. **Scalability**: Facilitates the addition of new features without affecting existing functionality.
3. **Testability**: Ensures that your application is easy to test at every level of the architecture.

## How It Works

The boilerplate is structured following the principles of Clean Architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI/UX and user interaction.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and domain-specific entities.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data access and repository patterns.

By separating these concerns, you can ensure that changes in one part of the application do not adversely affect others, promoting a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Navigation**: Using Expo Router for seamless navigation.
- **Styling**: Tailwind and Nativewind for efficient and responsive styling.
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) and Axios for data fetching and state management.
- **Storage**: MMKV and WatermelonDB for efficient data storage.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form and Zod for form management and validation.
- **State Management**: Zustand for managing application state.
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated, Moti, and React Native Skia for smooth and interactive animations.
- **Gesture Handling**: React Native Gesture Handler for handling gestures.
- **Automated Testing**: Jest, React Native Testing Library, and E2E testing with Maestro.
- **Push Notifications**: Notifee, OneSignal, or Expo Notifications for handling push notifications.
- **Internationalization**: i18next for internationalization and localization.
- **Authentication**: Supabase for authentication and user management.
